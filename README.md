## üé∂ FMI_SPOTIFY
FMI_SPOTIFY is a simple, Spotify-like client-server application developed in Java as part of a coursework project at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.
It allows users to stream `.wav` music files, search songs, and manage personal playlists ‚Äî all through a command-line interface.
The application uses sockets for streaming music, enabling real-time audio playback.
It demonstrates key concepts such as:
- Multithreading for handling multiple users and parallel queries
- Real-time streaming of audio data via sockets
- Persistent storage for user data and playlists stored in local files

### üñ•Ô∏è Spotify Server
Provides the following services:
- User registration and login
- Song catalog management
- Search songs by title or artist
- Playlists creation and management per user (Each user can have multiple different personal playlists)
- Statistics on most-played tracks
- Streaming `.wav` songs to clients over the network
  ** The server handles multiple users simultaneously, processing queries and streaming songs in parallel using multithreading.
  ** Each user query and song stream is processed in a separate thread

### üíª Spotify Client
Command-line client interface with support for:
** Interactive commands during song playback realized in separate threads
** Users can search, browse, and manage playlists while streaming music

| `stop` | Stop the current playback |

## üéß Music Streaming Details

- Streaming is based on `javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine`.
- Songs are streamed in real-time ‚Äî the playback starts without needing to download the entire file.
